# Introduction

A while ago I did an assignment for One shoe in order to pass their test. I needed to create a small app of my choosing. At that time I wanted to learn a Javascript framework and started with Vue. For some reason I fell in love. And with that framework I created a [Chuck Norris Jokes app](https://github.com/valentijnkap/chuck-norris-jokes-app/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file). Eventually I never got the chance to get some experience with this framework and the projects from One Shoe / IO drove me to learn Angular and React.

I learned a lot from those frameworks. Now NoBears asked me to create a vacancies website where you can filter between vacancies trough different variables in Nuxt. With the knowledge I gained from react and Angular I am goint to try nuxt out. Back to where I started to learn en discover it's capabilities.

Within this project I am going to try out some things:
- Tailwind (Not my preffered way but A friend told me to give this a chance)
- Vitest for unit testing the components
- Pinia | State management (not yet started)
- Storybook | Component library (not yet started)

## Installation

By setting up the project and some tryouts I accidently installed peer dependcies. Ofcourse I will clean up the mess but for now run:

```sh
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Commands

Starting the server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Testing the components:

```sh
npm run test
```

For improved development experience:

```sh
npm run dev:test
```

Linter:
```sh
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```
